  #   Tx = vector of treatments for n samples
  #   Y = n by p matrix of p rating scale items
  #   nc = number of components/factors; default is set to number of unique treatments
  #   eigen = eigendecomposition of cor(Y) from previous output of SV; useful for minimizing run-time of permutation tests
  # Outputs - a list with:
  #   MR = causal effects from treatments to factors
  #   RtW = causal effects from factors to treatments
  #   tx_effects = (MR) %*% (RtW), or the causal effects from treatments to factors
  #   optimal_outcomes = rotated factors
  #   R = the rotation matrix found by Varimax
  #   sgn = sign flip done to ensure sign determinancy
  #   io = re-ordering of optimal outcomes done to ensure permutation determinancy
  #   eigen = results of eigendecomposition
